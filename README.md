# TradeZ


## Philosophy
In the day and age when trading has become overly complicated - overcollateralization, flash swaps, flash loans, yield farming, rug pulling, draining, lost alpha. The main interest of the consumer has fallen out of the hands of large corporations and newly funded companies. While DeFAI and AI abstraction is attempting to mitigate these issues, maybe we need to take a step back and keep things very simple.


## Technical Stack
Frontend - TypeScript, NextJs
Backend - Solidity, Hardhat

## Next Steps
To find ways to further simplify the trading scene... Maybe breaking away from traditional finance and trading IP on-chain.

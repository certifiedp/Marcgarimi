## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, Hardhat
- **Wallet Connection**: RainbowKit, wagmi
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Deployment**: Sepolia Testnet

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Git
- MetaMask or another Web3 wallet browser extension
- Some Sepolia ETH for testing (available from [Sepolia faucets](https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/))

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/certifiedp/TradeZ.git
cd TradeZ
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Backend Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory using the provided example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Edit the `.env` file with your own values:
   - `PRIVATE_KEY`: Your Ethereum private key (without 0x prefix)
   - `SEPOLIA_API_URL`: Your Alchemy/Infura Sepolia API URL

4. Compile the contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

5. Deploy to Sepolia testnet:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

6. Note the deployed contract address and update it in `frontend/lib/contractConfig.ts`

## 🏆 Hackathon Judging

### Problem Statement

Many DeFi trading interfaces are unnecessarily complex, with overwhelming UIs and complicated features that alienate new users. TradeZ addresses this by providing a minimalist trading experience focused on usability and transparency.

### Innovation

TradeZ uses a hybrid rendering approach that optimizes for both performance and interactivity, leveraging Next.js 15's Server and Client Components. This creates a fast, responsive user experience while maintaining all the functionality expected from a trading interface.

### Technical Implementation

- Smart contract implements a simple but effective constant product pool
- Frontend optimizes client/server rendering boundaries for optimal performance
- RainbowKit integration provides seamless wallet connection
- Responsive design works across all devices

### User Experience

TradeZ puts simplicity first, with an intuitive interface that anyone can use without a deep understanding of DeFi concepts. The clear, predictable exchange rates and minimal controls make it accessible to both beginners and experienced traders.
